## Description:

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Moment.js to format timestamps. The seed data is created using Insomnia.

## User Story:

`AS A social media startup I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data`

## Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a social network API

- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
  - THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
  - THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
  - THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
  - THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user‚Äôs friend list

- Update a user by its `id`: `PUT /api/user/:userId`

- Delete a user by its `id`: `DELETE /api/user/:userId`

üìÅ **FRIEND**

- Add a new friend to a user's friend list: `POST /api/user/:userid/friends/:friendId`
- Delete a friend from a user's friend list: `DELETE /api/user/:userid/friends/:friendId`

üìÅ **THOUGHT**

- Create a new thought: `POST /api/thoughts/`
- Get all thoughts: `GET /api/thoughts/`
- Get a single thought by its `id`: `GET /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`
- Update a thought by its `id`: `PUT /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`
- Delete a thought by its `id`: `DELETE /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`

üìÅ **REACTION**
